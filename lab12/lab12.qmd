> Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
res <- read.table("https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F24/class-material/rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
```

```{r}
nrow(res)
```

```{r}
table(res$geno)
```

> Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(res) + aes(geno, exp, fill = geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = T)
```
